# Welcome to Numba how-to!

This is a documentation-only project that captures useful recipes to work with 
Numba. 

All recipes are shared as-is, without guarantees. They are merely indicative 
of what can be done with Numba, and each user must adapt it to their individual 
use case. These recipes have not undergone extensive testing, and it is up to 
each user to ensure that they do what they need them to do.
